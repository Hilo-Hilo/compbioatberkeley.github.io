        We make computational biology easier to enter and more useful to practice. Members can learn
        core methods, meet collaborators across disciplines, and apply those skills in student-led
        work. Our public calendar, officer directory, collaboration information, and interest forms
        are the best starting points for students and partners looking for current opportunities.

            Computational biology brings software, statistics, and biological knowledge together to
            study living systems and health. Students arrive from many majors, so participation does
            not depend on already knowing every part of that toolkit. Workshops and peer learning
            create a shared foundation before members move into deeper research or project work.
          </p>
          <p>
            New members can begin with a public event, join the update list, and meet students who
            are learning the same methods. As their interests develop, they can explore technical
            projects, leadership, professional conversations, and connections with research groups.
            The organization is a place to ask informed questions and build experience with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Faculty, researchers, alumni, and industry teams can use the collaboration page to
            propose a talk, mentorship opportunity, research problem, or partnership. The calendar
            and officer roster provide current public context, while the contact page identifies the
            verified channels for reaching the student team without relying on an outdated address.
