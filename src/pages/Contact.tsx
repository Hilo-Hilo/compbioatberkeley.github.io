          Students looking to participate should begin with the Join page. Potential project,
          research, speaker, or sponsorship partners should review Collaborations. For scheduled
          activities, the Calendar is the canonical public event source. Providing the relevant
          program, date, and desired next step in your first message makes it easier for our officers
          to respond.
